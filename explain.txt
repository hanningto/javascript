Question 3: What is the output of the following code. Explain

let obj = {};
obj[1] = 'One';
obj['1'] = 'String One';

console.log(obj[1]);
console.log(obj['1']);
console.log(obj[1] === obj['1']);

The above code will give the following output:
String One
String One
true

Explanation
line 1: let obj = {}; --> this line declares an empty object variable
line 2: obj[1] = 'One'; --> this line assigns the value 'One' to the object obj at the index 1
line 3: obj['1'] = 'String One'; this line assigns the value 'String One' to the object obj at the index 1,
                                 since javascript is not strict on data types; 1 is interprated the same as '1', 
                                 hence the initial assignment is overwritten
